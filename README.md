# CS-305-Software-Security

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a client of Global Rain that specializes in consulting. They develop individualized financial plans for their customers that include savings plans, retirement plans, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial has tasked Global Rain to help modernize their operations. Since they deal with extremely sensitive private data from their users, they want to ensure their platform utilizes the latest and most effective software security practices. Artemis Financial has a public web interface that their clients use to access their information, accounts, and more. Global Rain's expertise could help Artemis Financial establish a safe and secure platform that their clients can trust. To do this, Global Rain implements a verifcation step to their web application platform that ensures secure communications between the server and the client. This is especially important when transferring data as you do not want the sensitive data to be intercepted by malicious attackers.

- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Coding securely is extremely important, for both the organization and the client. Writing secure data mitigates the risk of potential attacks, like brute force attacks and SQL injections. With safe coding practices and testing, you avoid the risks of being attacked solely based off the fact that your code was not developed properly or ignores vulernabilites. This is important for both the organization and the client, and is beneficial for companies since secure code complies with many rules and regulations.

- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I felt that the vulernability assessment was very helpful. Not only did this course introduce me to the world of vulnerability assesements, but now I fully understand how these vulernabilites are found and how they should be dealt with. Although it is still a difficult topic to master, being able to better understand how these vulernabilties are tackled was extremely helpful to me.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

By using established encryption practices, and more specifically SHA-256, I was able to increase the layers of security. SHA-256 is an algorithm cipher that masks strings such as passwords, emails, and more that serve as a form of "abstraction". SHA-256 turns unique strings into its own unique hash of 256 bits. 

- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Checking dependency reports and testing my code was the most optimal way for me to make certain my code was functional and secure. Dependency reports are able to show me any new vulnerabilities as well as helps me keep track of the latest vulernabilities I have addressed.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Developing certificates and using JKS was a practice that I learned from this course that will be helpful in my future endeavors.

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

If I had to show an employer an example of my work from this assignment it would be my ability to develop secure code to establish proper secure connections between server and client via certificates.
